## NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand ##

The **NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand** is a set of custom NI TestStand step types used to automate NI VeriStand from an NI TestStand sequence. 

The steps are divided into groups which provide functionality like project control, channel read/write access, alarms, real-time sequences, logging, and faulting.

The NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand are distributed as *open-source* software and released under the *BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License*.
