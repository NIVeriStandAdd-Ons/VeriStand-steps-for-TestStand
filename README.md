## NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand ##

The **NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand** is a set of custom TestStand step types used to automate NI VeriStand from a TestStand sequence. 

The steps are divided into several groups of steps which provide functionality like project control, channel read/write access, alarms, real-time sequences, logging, and faulting.

The NI VeriStand Steps for TestStand are distributed as *open-source* software and released under the *BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License*.
